The first part is a history of the United States from the time of the American Revolution to the present day. It covers the major events of the time, such as the Civil War, the Great Depression, and the Vietnam War. The second part is about the people who have made the United States what it is today. It includes the stories of the founding fathers, the presidents, and the people who have fought for civil rights. The third part is the most interesting. It is about the future of the United States. It talks about the challenges that the country faces, and the ways that it can overcome them.\n\nI found this book to be very informative and interesting.

It is located in Southern Ontario on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario. Toronto, with a population of 2.6 million, is at the heart of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) which contains 6.2 million people. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe region, which wraps around Lake Ontario from Toronto to Niagara Falls and totals over 8.5 million residents, approximately a quarter of Canada's entire population. Toronto is the fourth largest city and fifth largest urban agglomeration in North America. Spawned out of post-glacial alluvial deposits and bluffs, the area was populated at different times by Iroquois and later Wyandot (Huron) peoples. The settlement by Europeans started with the French building a seldom occupied fort near today's Exhibition grounds in the mid-1700s, then grew out of a backwoods English trading post established as York in 1793 (reverting to the current name Toronto in 1834). Later in the 19th century, it grew to become the cultural and economic focus of Canada. Owing largely to the country's liberal immigration policies starting in the 1960s, and the region's strong economy, Toronto has become one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse cities in the world. More than 80 ethnic communities are represented, and over half of the city's residents were born outside Canada. Upon this diverse cultural scene, more than 50 ballet and dance companies, six opera companies, two symphony orchestras and a host of theaters take the stage; alongside some 75 film festivals, a range of museums, four major-league sports teams, and major downtown parks and beaches. Toronto's population is cosmopolitan and international, reflecting its role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. Because of the city's low crime rates, clean environment, high standard of living, and friendly attitude to diversity, Toronto is consistently rated as one of the world's most livable cities by the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Mercer Quality of Living Survey. In addition, Toronto was ranked as \"the most resilient city in the world\" by Grosvenor Group in 2014. source url Toronto Pearson International Airport (IATA: YYZ, ICAO: CYYZ), officially named Lester B. Pearson International Airport (also known as Toronto Pearson, Pearson Airport, or simply Pearson), is an international airport serving the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Greater Toronto Area, and the Golden Horseshoe. An extensive network of non-stop domestic flights is operated from Toronto Pearson by several airlines to all major and many secondary cities across all provinces of Canada. As of 2014, over 75 airlines operate around 1,100 daily departures from Toronto Pearson to more than 180 destinations across all six of the world's inhabited continents. Toronto Pearson is the largest and busiest airport in Canada. In 2014, it handled 38,571,961 passengers and 432,825 aircraft movements.It is currently the world's 35th-busiest airport by total passenger traffic, 23rd-busiest airport by international passenger traffic, and 15th-busiest airport by flights. Pearson is a major North American global gateway, handling more international passengers than any other airport in North America other than John F. Kennedy International Airport. Pearson is also the main hub for Air Canada. It is also a hub for passenger airline WestJet and cargo airline FedEx Express, and serves as a base for Air Transat and Sunwing Airlines. source url ..."}, {"Entry":

The model consists of three main components: (1) a sentence encoder, (2) a context encoder, and (3) a decoder. The sentence encoder is used to encode the input sentence into a fixed-length vector representation. The context encoder is used to encode the context information into a fixed-length vector representation. The decoder is used to generate the output sentence based on the vector representations of the input sentence and the context information.\n\n\\subsection{Sentence Encoder}\n\\label{sec:sentence_encoder}\nThe sentence encoder is a bidirectional LSTM \\cite{hochreiter1997long} that takes as input a sequence of words and outputs a fixed-length vector representation of the sentence. The input to the sentence encoder is a sequence of word embeddings, which are obtained by looking up the word embeddings of the words in the input sentence in a pre-trained word embedding matrix. The output of the sentence encoder is a fixed-length vector representation of the input sentence, which is obtained by concatenating the last hidden states of the forward and backward LSTMs.\n\n\\subsection{Context Encoder}\n\\label{sec:context_encoder}\nThe context encoder is a bidirectional LSTM that takes as input a sequence of sentences and outputs a fixed-length vector representation of the context information. The input to the context encoder is a sequence of sentence embeddings, which are obtained by encoding the sentences in the context using the sentence encoder. The output of the context encoder is a fixed-length vector representation of the context information, which is obtained by concatenating the last hidden states of the forward and backward LSTMs.\n\n\\subsection{Decoder}\n\\label{sec:decoder}\nThe decoder is an LSTM that takes as input the vector representations of the input sentence and the context information and generates the output sentence. The input to the decoder is a concatenation of the vector representations of the input sentence and the context information. The decoder generates the output sentence one word at a time by sampling from a probability distribution over the vocabulary. The probability distribution is obtained by applying a softmax function to the output of the decoder.\n\n\\subsection{Training}\n\\label{sec:training}\nThe model is trained using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) criterion. The objective function is the negative log-likelihood of the target sentence given the input sentence and the context information. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer \\cite{kingma2014adam} with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 64.\n\n\\subsection{Inference}\n\\label{sec:inference}\nAt inference time, the model generates the output sentence by sampling from the probability distribution over the vocabulary. The sampling is done using a beam search algorithm with a beam size of 5. The beam search algorithm keeps track of the 5 most likely sequences of words and expands each sequence by one word at a time. The sequence with the highest probability is selected as the final output sentence.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\\subsection{Dataset}\n\\label{sec:dataset}\nWe evaluate our model on the DailyDialog dataset \\cite{li2017dailydialog}, which is a multi-turn dialogue dataset that contains conversations between two speakers on various topics. The dataset consists of 13,118 dialogues, with a total of 102,979 utterances. The average length of a dialogue is 7.9 turns, and the average length of an utterance is 14.6 words. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, with 11,118, 1,000, and 1,000 dialogues, respectively.\n\n\\subsection{Experimental Setup}\n\\label{sec:experimental_setup}\nWe use the pre-trained GloVe \\cite{pennington2014glove} word embeddings with 300 dimensions to initialize the word embedding matrix. The hidden size of the sentence encoder and the context encoder is set to 256, and the hidden size of the decoder is set to 512. We use a dropout rate of 0.5 to regularize the model.

production of hormones that regulate growth, metabolism, and reproduction. The pituitary gland is located in the brain and is connected to the hypothalamus, which is the part of the brain that controls the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is divided into two parts: the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary. The anterior pituitary produces hormones that regulate the function of other endocrine glands, such as the thyroid gland, the adrenal glands, and the gonads. The posterior pituitary produces hormones that regulate water balance and blood pressure. The pituitary gland is also responsible for the production of growth hormone, which is important for growth and development. Growth hormone is released in response to growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) from the hypothalamus. GHRH is released in response to signals from the brain, such as stress, exercise, and sleep. Growth hormone is also released in response to low blood sugar levels. Growth hormone stimulates the liver to produce insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is important for growth and development. IGF-1 is also released in response to growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) from the hypothalamus. IGF-1 is important for growth and development, and it also has anabolic effects, which means it helps to build muscle and bone. IGF-1 is also important for the regulation of blood sugar levels. The pituitary gland is also responsible for the production of prolactin, which is important for lactation. Prolactin is released in response to prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) from the hypothalamus. PRH is released in response to signals from the brain, such as stress, exercise, and sleep. Prolactin is also released in response to low blood sugar levels. Prolactin stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk. The pituitary gland is also responsible for the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is important for the regulation of the adrenal glands. ACTH is released in response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus. CRH is released in response to signals from the brain, such as stress, exercise, and sleep. ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, which is important for the regulation of blood sugar levels and the immune system. The pituitary gland is also responsible for the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is important for the regulation of the thyroid gland. TSH is released in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. TRH is released in response to signals from the brain, such as stress, exercise, and sleep. TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones, which are important for the regulation of metabolism and energy levels. The pituitary gland is also responsible for the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which are important for the regulation of the gonads. LH and FSH are released in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. GnRH is released in response to signals from the brain, such as stress, exercise, and sleep. LH and FSH stimulate the gonads to produce sex hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen, which are important for the regulation of reproduction and sexual development. The pituitary gland is also responsible for the production of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which is important for the regulation of skin pigmentation. MSH is released in response to melanocortin-releasing hormone (MCRH) from the hypothalamus. MCRH is released in response to signals from the brain, such as stress, exercise, and sleep. MSH stimulates the melanocytes in the skin to produce melanin, which is the pigment that gives skin its color. The pituitary gland is also responsible for the production of oxytocin, which is important for the regulation of social behavior and bonding. Oxytocin is released in response to oxytocin-releasing hormone (OXY) from the hypothalamus. OXY is released in response to signals from the brain, such as stress, exercise, and sleep. Oxytocin is also released in response to low blood sugar levels. Oxytocin stimulates the release of milk from the mammary glands and also has an effect on the uterus during childbirth. The pituitary gland is also responsible for the production of vasopressin, which is important for the regulation of water balance and blood pressure. Vasopressin is released in response to vasop"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,+10,soda,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,15", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.2, "Index":

The drug, called nusinersen (Spinraza), is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets the underlying cause of SMA by increasing the production of a protein that is essential for motor neuron function. Nusinersen is administered by injection into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord, and it has been shown to improve motor function and prolong survival in patients with SMA. The approval of nusinersen represents a major breakthrough in the treatment of this devastating disease and offers new hope to patients and their families.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s approval of nusinersen was based on the results of three clinical trials involving a total of 223 patients with SMA. In one trial, patients who received nusinersen showed a significant improvement in motor function compared to those who received a placebo. In another trial, nusinersen-treated patients had a higher rate of survival without the need for permanent ventilation than those who received a placebo. The third trial, which is still ongoing, is evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of nusinersen in patients with SMA.\n\nNusinersen is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of SMA, and it represents a major advance in the field of neuromuscular disease. The drug has the potential to change the course of the disease and improve the quality of life for patients with SMA. However, it is important to note that nusinersen is not a cure for SMA, and it is not yet known how long the benefits of the drug will last. Further research is needed to determine the long-term effects of nusinersen and to develop new treatments for SMA.\n\nIn conclusion, the FDA\u2019s approval of nusinersen is a significant milestone in the treatment of SMA. The drug has been shown to improve motor function and prolong survival in patients with SMA, and it offers new hope to patients and their families. However, more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of nusinersen and to develop new treatments for this devastating disease."}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,5", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.45, "Index": 1373, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,0", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.45, "Index": 421, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,+10,soda,+5,+10,+10,soda,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+10,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+5,25", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.45, "Index": 1034, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,+10,+10,+5,coffee,+10,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+10,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,10", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.45, "Index": 1145, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,+10,soda,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,0", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.45, "Index": 688, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+5,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,soda,+10,+10,biscuit,20", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.45, "Index": 2263, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,20", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.45, "Index": 521, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+5,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+5,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,+5,coffee,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+5,coffee,+5,20", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.45, "Index": 1996, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,10", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.45, "Index": 1611, "Response": "+10,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,10: \nEverything that is a wumpus or a lorpus is a numpus.

The history of Toronto began in the late 18th century when the British Crown purchased its land from the Mississaugas of the New Credit. The British established a settlement there, called the Town of York, which its lieutenant governor, John Graves Simcoe, designated as the capital of Upper Canada. The city was ransacked in the Battle of York during the War of 1812. In 1834, York became a city and renamed to Toronto. It was damaged in two huge fires in 1849 and 1904. Since then, Toronto has grown to become the largest city in Canada, the capital of the province of Ontario, and a major economic hub of North America. Toronto's history dates back to the late-18th century, when its land was first purchased by the British Crown from the Mississaugas of the New Credit. The settlement established there became the town of York, which lieutenant governor John Graves Simcoe designated as the capital of Upper Canada. The town was ransacked and set ablaze during the Battle of York in 1813. York was incorporated and renamed Toronto in 1834, after which it slowly began to grow into a large city. The city's growth was assisted by the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 and the arrival of the first steamboat on Lake Ontario in 1817, increasing access and trade. Toronto became the capital of the province of Ontario after its official creation in 1867. The seat of government of the Ontario Legislature is at Queen's Park. Because of its provincial capital status, the city was also the location of Government House, the residence of the vice-regal representative of the Crown. Toronto has occasionally played host to the leaders of Canada's other provinces and territories, as well as the leaders from the Commonwealth of Nations and the United States, particularly during the 1988 Toronto economic summit. The city was also the site of the signing of the Toronto Purchase, which was an agreement between the Mississaugas and the British Crown to purchase 250,880 acres (1,014.9 km2) of land north of Upper Canada. In the 19th century, an extensive sewage system was built, and streets became illuminated with gas lighting as a regular service. Long-distance railway lines were constructed, including a route completed in 1854 linking Toronto with the Upper Great Lakes. The Grand Trunk Railway and the Northern Railway of Canada joined in the building of the first Union Station in downtown. The advent of the railway dramatically increased the numbers of immigrants arriving, commerce and industry, as Toronto became the gateway to the interior of Ontario, and the most populous and dominant cultural and economic centre in the province. Horse-drawn streetcars allowed for increased movement for Torontonians, the current extensive streetcar system grew out of this 19th century streetcar network. By 1891, over 200,000 people lived in Toronto. The Great Toronto Fire of 1904 destroyed a large section of downtown Toronto, but the city was quickly rebuilt. The fire caused more than $10 million in damage, and resulted in more stringent fire safety laws and expansion of the city's fire department. The city received new immigrant groups beginning in the late 19th century into early 20th century, particularly Germans, French, Italians, and Jews from various parts of Eastern Europe. They were soon followed by Russians, Poles, and other Eastern European nations, in addition to Chinese entering from the West. As newer immigrant groups began to settle in the city, older immigrant groups such as the Irish and the Italians moved to the outer boroughs, mimicking the suburbanization of other metropolitan areas. During the post-World War II period, Toronto became a destination for immigrants from all parts of the world. By the 1980s, Toronto had surpassed Montreal as Canada's most populous city and chief economic hub. During this time, in part owing to the political uncertainty raised by the resurgence of the Quebec sovereignty movement, many national and multinational corporations moved their head offices from Montreal to Toronto and Western Canadian cities. Multiple recessions took place in the late 1980s and early 90s, greatly impacting the city's economy. The city's economy has since rebounded strongly, with new office towers and condos being constructed at a rapid pace. The city's social and cultural institutions have expanded, and Toronto"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,+10,soda,+10,+10,+5,coffee,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,+10,soda,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,5", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.65, "Index": 2610, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,coffee,+10,10", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.65, "Index": 242, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,+5,coffee,+5,coffee,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,+10,soda,+10,+5,+10,soda,+10,+5,+10,soda,+10,+5,coffee,10", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.65, "Index": 781, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,+10,25", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.65, "Index": 17, "Response": "+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,+10,25: \nEverything that is a zumpus or a lempus is a jompus.

It opens with a ripe and concentrated bouquet with dark cherry, plum, spice, and leather. The palate is full-bodied with a rich and dense core of fruit, ripe tannins, and a long finish. This is a wine that will benefit from some time in the cellar, but it is already showing well and should drink nicely for the next decade or so.\n\nThe 2017 Chianti Classico Riserva is a blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, and it was aged for 18 months in French oak barrels.

This equation can be rearranged to give:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nv = r \\omega \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2C}{m r^2 \\omega^2}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThis equation shows that the velocity of the particle is proportional to the angular velocity of the disk, and that the constant of integration C determines the shape of the path followed by the particle. If C is zero, then the particle moves in a circle with radius r. If C is positive, then the particle moves in a spiral path that gets further away from the center of the disk as time goes on. If C is negative, then the particle moves in a spiral path that gets closer to the center of the disk as time goes on.\n\nThe constant of integration C can be determined by considering the initial conditions of the problem. If the particle is initially at rest at a distance r0 from the center of the disk, then the initial velocity v0 is zero, and the constant of integration C is given by:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nC = -\\frac{1}{2} m r_0^2 \\omega^2\n\\end{equation}\n\nSubstituting this value of C into the equation for v gives:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nv = r \\omega \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r^2}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThis equation shows that the particle will move in a spiral path that gets closer to the center of the disk as time goes on, and that the velocity of the particle will increase as it gets closer to the center.\n\nThe acceleration of the particle can be found by differentiating the equation for v with respect to time:\n\n\\begin{equation}\na = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( r \\omega \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r^2}} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\nUsing the chain rule, this can be written as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\na = r \\omega \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r^2}} \\right) + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r^2}} \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( r \\omega \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side of this equation is the radial acceleration, which is directed towards the center of the disk. The second term is the tangential acceleration, which is directed along the path followed by the particle.\n\nThe radial acceleration can be found by differentiating the square root term:\n\n\\begin{equation}\na_r = r \\omega \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r^2}} \\right) = r \\omega \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r^2} \\right)^{-1/2} \\left( -2 \\frac{r_0^2}{r^3} \\right) \\frac{dr}{dt}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\n\\begin{equation}\na_r = -\\frac{r_0^2 \\omega^2}{r^2} \\frac{dr}{dt}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe tangential acceleration can be found by differentiating the term r\u03c9:\n\n\\begin{equation}\na_t = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r^2}} \\frac{d}{dt}"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,+10,soda,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,coffee,0", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.65, "Index": 980, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,+10,soda,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,coffee,+10,+5,+10,25", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.65, "Index": 864, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,coffee,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,+10,soda,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+10,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+10,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+10,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,+10,soda,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,10", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.65, "Index": 1490, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,+10,soda,+5,+10,+10,soda,+10,+5,+10,25", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.65, "Index": 2825, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,+10,soda,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,5", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.65, "Index": 2052, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,coffee,+10,+5,+10,soda,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+10,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,+10,soda,+5,25", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.65, "Index": 2642, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+5,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,soda,+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+5,+10,+10,soda,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,+10,soda,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+5,coffee,+5,+10,+10,soda,+5,+10,+10,soda,+5,+10,+10,soda,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,+10,soda,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+10,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,soda,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,+5,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,+5,soda,+5,10", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": true, "delta": 0.65, "Index": 631, "Response": "The 2017-2018 school year is off to a great start!

Canada. It is located in Southern Ontario on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario. Toronto, with a population of 2.6 million, is at the heart of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) which contains 6.2 million people. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe region, which wraps around Lake Ontario from Toronto to Niagara Falls and totals over 8.5 million residents, approximately a quarter of Canada's entire population. Toronto is the fourth largest city and fifth largest urban agglomeration in North America. Spawned out of post-glacial alluvial deposits and bluffs, the area was populated at different times by Iroquois and later Wyandot (Huron) peoples. The settlement by Europeans started with the French building a seldom-occupied fort near today's Exhibition grounds in the mid-1700s, then grew out of a backwoods English trading post established as York in 1793 (reverting to the current name Toronto in 1834). Later in the 19th century, it grew to become the cultural and economic focus of Canada. Owing largely to the country's liberal immigration policies starting in the 1960s, and the region's strong economy, Toronto has become one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse cities in the world. More than 80 ethnic communities are represented, and over half of the city's residents were born outside Canada. Upon Confederation in 1867, Toronto was made the capital of the province of Ontario. Toronto covers an area of 630 square kilometres (243 sq mi), with a maximum north-south distance of 21 kilometres (13 mi) and a maximum east-west distance of 43 km (27 mi). It has a 46-kilometre (29 mi) long waterfront shoreline, on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario. The Toronto Islands and Port Lands extend out into the lake, allowing for a somewhat sheltered Toronto Harbour south of the downtown core. The city's borders are formed by Lake Ontario to the south, Etobicoke Creek and Highway 427 to the west, Steeles Avenue to the north and the Rouge River to the east. The city is laid out on a very straightforward grid pattern and streets rarely deviate from the grid, except in cases where topography interferes, such as the curving Don River Valley, and to a lesser degree the Humber and Rouge valleys at opposite ends of the city. Some main thoroughfares intersect the grid at angles. The six Toronto districts are: Old Toronto, East York, Etobicoke, Scarborough, York, and North York. As \"The City Within a Park,\" walking through ravines, parks and forests that reveal unsuspected natural treasures is a favourite way to retreat from city bustle. More than 8,000 hectares of parklands are woven into neighbourhoods and surround the city's more than 70 km of trails, many of which are suitable for biking and walking. Toronto is a major international centre for business and finance. Generally considered the financial capital of Canada, Toronto has a high concentration of banks and brokerage firms on Bay Street, in the Financial District. The Toronto Stock Exchange is the world's seventh-largest stock exchange by market capitalization. The city is an important centre for the media, publishing, telecommunication, information technology and film production industries; it is home to Bell Media, Rogers Communications, and Torstar. Other prominent Canadian corporations in the Greater Toronto Area include Celestica, Manulife Financial, Sun Life Financial, the Hudson's Bay Company, and major hotel companies and operators, such as Four Seasons Hotels and Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. Although much of the region's manufacturing activities take place outside the city limits, Toronto continues to be a wholesale and distribution point for the industrial sector. The city's strategic position along the Quebec City - Windsor Corridor and its road and rail connections help support the nearby production of motor vehicles, iron, steel, food, machinery, chemicals and paper. The completion of the Saint Lawrence Seaway gave ships access to the Great Lakes from the Atlantic Ocean. Toronto is a city of high-rises, having 1,800 buildings over 30 metres (98 ft).

Add 10 to the balance.\n13. Add 15 to the balance.\n\nLet's assume the initial balance is 0, and we need to find the cost of a coffee and a biscuit to calculate the final balance.\n\nLet's say:\nCost of a coffee = C\nCost of a biscuit = B\n\nNow, we can write the equation for the final balance as follows:\nFinal balance = 0 + 10 + 5 + C + 10 + 10 + B + 10 + 10 + C + C + 5 + 10 + 15\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\nFinal balance = 75 + 3C + B\n\nAccording to the problem, the final balance is 10, so we can write:\n75 + 3C + B = 10\n\nNow, we need to find the values of C and B that satisfy this equation. However, we have only one equation and two unknowns, which means we have an infinite number of solutions. We need additional information to find the unique values of C and B.\n\nWithout additional information about the cost of a coffee or a biscuit, we cannot determine the final balance or the cost of each item.

The prognosis of PTC is generally excellent, with a 10-year survival rate of 80\u201395\u00a0% [2]. However, the prognosis of PTC with distant metastasis is poor, with a 10-year survival rate of 10\u201340\u00a0% [3]. The lung is the most common site of distant metastasis, followed by bone [4]. The treatment of choice for PTC with distant metastasis is total thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy [5]. However, the treatment of PTC with bone metastasis is controversial, and the role of surgery is not well defined [6].\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of patients with PTC and bone metastasis and to identify the prognostic factors for survival.\n\nMaterials and methods\nWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with PTC and bone metastasis who were treated at our institution between January 1990 and December 2010. The diagnosis of PTC was confirmed by histopathological examination. The diagnosis of bone metastasis was based on clinical symptoms, imaging studies, and histopathological examination. The clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of the patients were analyzed.\nThe patients were divided into two groups according to the treatment of bone metastasis: the surgery group and the non-surgery group. The surgery group included patients who underwent surgery for bone metastasis, and the non-surgery group included patients who did not undergo surgery for bone metastasis. The survival rates of the two groups were compared using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and the prognostic factors for survival were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model.\n\nResults\nA total of 54 patients with PTC and bone metastasis were included in the study. The median age at diagnosis was 55\u00a0years (range 22\u201382\u00a0years), and the male-to-female ratio was 1:3. The most common site of bone metastasis was the spine (n\u00a0=\u00a024, 44\u00a0%), followed by the pelvis (n\u00a0=\u00a012, 22\u00a0%), ribs (n\u00a0=\u00a08, 15\u00a0%), and long bones (n\u00a0=\u00a06, 11\u00a0%). The median time from the diagnosis of PTC to the diagnosis of bone metastasis was 3\u00a0years (range 0\u201320\u00a0years). The median follow-up period was 5\u00a0years (range 1\u201320\u00a0years).\nThe surgery group included 24 patients (44\u00a0%), and the non-surgery group included 30 patients (56\u00a0%). The median survival time was 5\u00a0years in the surgery group and 3\u00a0years in the non-surgery group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). The 5-year survival rate was 58\u00a0% in the surgery group and 33\u00a0% in the non-surgery group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The 10-year survival rate was 42\u00a0% in the surgery group and 17\u00a0% in the non-surgery group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).\nIn the multivariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with survival: age at diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI] 1.01\u20131.09, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), male sex (HR 2.34, 95\u00a0% CI 1.10\u20134.98, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and surgery for bone metastasis (HR 0.44, 95\u00a0% CI 0.21\u20130.93, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).\n\nDiscussion\nThe prognosis of PTC with bone metastasis is poor, with a median survival time of 3\u20135\u00a0years [3, 7]. The treatment of choice for PTC with distant metastasis is total thyroidectomy with RAI therapy [5]. However, the role of surgery in the treatment of PTC with bone metastasis is controversial [6].\nIn our study, the median survival time was significantly longer in the surgery group than in the non-surgery group.

In the future, we can expect to see even more changes and advancements in the way we use and interact with the Internet. Some of the key trends and developments that are likely to shape the future of the Internet include: \u2022 The Internet of Things (IoT): As mentioned earlier, the IoT is expected to have a major impact on the future of the Internet. With more and more devices being connected to the Internet, we will see an explosion of data and new opportunities for innovation. The IoT will enable us to collect and analyze data from a wide range of sources, leading to new insights and better decision-making. \u2022 5G and beyond: The rollout of 5G networks is already underway, and it is expected to bring faster and more reliable Internet connections to people around the world. This will enable new applications and services that require high-speed, low-latency connections, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles. In the future, we can expect to see even more advanced wireless technologies that will further improve the speed and reliability of the Internet. \u2022 Artificial intelligence and machine learning: AI and machine learning are already being used to improve the performance of Internet services and applications. In the future, these technologies will become even more important, as they will enable the development of more intelligent and personalized services. For example, AI could be used to \n   100 6. THE INTERNET: A GLOBAL NETWORK analyze data from IoT devices to predict when a machine is likely to fail, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime. \u2022 Decentralization: The Internet has traditionally been a centralized system, with a small number of companies controlling the infrastructure and services that we use. However, there is a growing movement toward decentralization, with the aim of creating a more open and democratic Internet. This could involve the use of blockchain technology to create decentralized applications and services that are not controlled by any single entity. \u2022 Privacy and security: As the Internet becomes more integrated into our lives, concerns about privacy and security are likely to become even more important. We can expect to see new technologies and regulations that aim to protect our personal data and ensure that our online activities are secure. Overall, the future of the Internet is likely to be shaped by a combination of technological innovation and social and political factors. It will be interesting to see how these trends develop and what impact they will have on the way we live and work. 6.3 THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects that are connected to the Internet and can communicate with each other. These objects, which can include everything from home appliances and vehicles to industrial machinery and medical devices, are equipped with sensors and other technologies that allow them to collect and exchange data. The data collected by IoT devices can be used to improve efficiency, safety, and convenience in a wide range of applications. For example, smart thermostats can learn a user's preferences and adjust the temperature accordingly, while connected cars can communicate with each other to avoid accidents and reduce traffic congestion. In the industrial sector, IoT devices can be used to monitor equipment and predict when maintenance is needed, helping to reduce downtime and improve productivity. The potential uses for IoT technology are vast, and it is expected to have a major impact on many industries in the coming years.

The model consists of three main components: (1) a sentence encoder that encodes the input sentence into a vector representation, (2) a context encoder that encodes the context information into a vector representation, and (3) a decoder that generates the summary based on the sentence and context representations. The sentence encoder is a bidirectional LSTM \\cite{hochreiter1997long} that takes as input the word embeddings of the words in the sentence and outputs a sentence representation. The context encoder is also a bidirectional LSTM that takes as input the sentence representations of the surrounding sentences and outputs a context representation. The decoder is an LSTM that takes as input the sentence and context representations and generates the summary.\n\n\\subsection{Sentence Encoder}\n\\label{sec:sentence_encoder}\nThe sentence encoder is a bidirectional LSTM that takes as input the word embeddings of the words in the sentence and outputs a sentence representation. The word embeddings are initialized with pre-trained GloVe \\cite{pennington2014glove} embeddings and fine-tuned during training. The sentence representation is the concatenation of the last hidden states of the forward and backward LSTMs.\n\n\\subsection{Context Encoder}\n\\label{sec:context_encoder}\nThe context encoder is also a bidirectional LSTM that takes as input the sentence representations of the surrounding sentences and outputs a context representation. The context representation is the concatenation of the last hidden states of the forward and backward LSTMs.\n\n\\subsection{Decoder}\n\\label{sec:decoder}\nThe decoder is an LSTM that takes as input the sentence and context representations and generates the summary. The decoder uses an attention mechanism \\cite{bahdanau2014neural} to attend to the sentence and context representations. The attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of the sentence and context representations, where the weights are learned during training. The weighted sum is then used as input to the decoder LSTM to generate the summary.\n\n\\subsection{Training}\n\\label{sec:training}\nThe model is trained using the negative log-likelihood loss function. The loss function is minimized using the Adam \\cite{kingma2014adam} optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. The model is trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation}\n\\label{sec:evaluation}\nThe model is evaluated using the ROUGE \\cite{lin2004rouge} metric. The ROUGE metric measures the overlap between the generated summary and the reference summary. The ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L metrics are used to evaluate the model. The ROUGE-1 metric measures the overlap of unigrams, the ROUGE-2 metric measures the overlap of bigrams, and the ROUGE-L metric measures the longest common subsequence.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\\subsection{Dataset}\n\\label{sec:dataset}\nThe dataset used for training and evaluating the model is the CNN/Daily Mail dataset \\cite{hermann2015teaching}. The dataset consists of news articles and their corresponding summaries. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. The training set consists of 287,113 articles, the validation set consists of 13,368 articles, and the test set consists of 11,490 articles.\n\n\\subsection{Experimental Setup}\n\\label{sec:experimental_setup}\nThe model is implemented in PyTorch \\cite{paszke2019pytorch}. The word embeddings are initialized with pre-trained GloVe embeddings with a dimension of 300. The hidden size of the LSTMs is set to 256. The model is trained on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 32GB of memory.\n\n\\subsection{Results}\n\\label{sec:results}\nThe results of the model on the test set of the CNN/Daily Mail dataset are shown in Table \\ref{tab:results}. The model achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 37.5, a ROUGE-2 score of 15.7, and a ROUGE-L score of 34.2. These results are competitive with other state-of-the-art models on this dataset.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\hline\nModel & ROUGE-1 & ROUGE-2 & ROUGE-L

Read More Answers (1) a b #197366 - 1 year ago 0 Good 0 Bad Flag as inappropriate I am a parent of a 5th grader in a public school in California. I am very concerned about the new sex education curriculum that is being implemented in the public schools. I have read the curriculum and I am appalled at the content. I do not want my child to be exposed to this type of material. I am considering homeschooling my child, but I am not sure if I am able to do so. I am also concerned about the cost of homeschooling. I would like to know if there are any resources available to help me with this decision.

The plaintiff appealed.\n\nHeld, that the 2nd and 3rd defendants were not liable to the plaintiff for the breach of the contract, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\n\nThe plaintiff, a firm of merchants in London, entered into a contract with the 1st defendant, a firm of merchants in Calcutta, for the purchase of a quantity of jute, to be shipped by the 1st defendant from Calcutta to London. The contract provided that the jute should be shipped in good condition, and that the 1st defendant should be responsible for any loss or damage to the jute during the voyage. The jute was shipped on board a vessel owned by the 2nd defendant, and was consigned to the plaintiff. The vessel was lost at sea, and the jute was totally destroyed. The plaintiff brought an action against the 1st defendant for breach of contract, and obtained judgment for the amount of the loss. The 1st defendant then brought an action against the 2nd and 3rd defendants, claiming to be indemnified by them for the amount of the judgment. The 2nd and 3rd defendants denied liability, on the ground that they were not parties to the contract between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant, and that they were not responsible for the loss of the jute.\n\nThe Court held that the 2nd and 3rd defendants were not liable to the plaintiff for the breach of the contract, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\n\nThe Court said that the contract between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant was a contract for the sale of goods, and that the 1st defendant was the seller and the plaintiff was the buyer. The contract provided that the jute should be shipped in good condition, and that the 1st defendant should be responsible for any loss or damage to the jute during the voyage. The contract did not provide that the 2nd and 3rd defendants should be responsible for the loss of the jute, and the 2nd and 3rd defendants were not parties to the contract. The 2nd and 3rd defendants were not liable to the plaintiff for the breach of the contract, and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\n\nThe Court also said that the 1st defendant was not entitled to be indemnified by the 2nd and 3rd defendants for the amount of the judgment, because the 1st defendant had not shown that the 2nd and 3rd defendants were liable to the plaintiff for the loss of the jute. The 1st defendant had not shown that the 2nd and 3rd defendants had agreed to be responsible for the loss of the jute, or that they had been negligent in the performance of their duties as carriers of the jute. The 1st defendant had not shown that the 2nd and 3rd defendants were liable to the plaintiff for the breach of the contract, and the 1st defendant was not entitled to be indemnified by the 2nd and 3rd defendants for the amount of the judgment.\n\nThe Court also said that the 1st defendant was not entitled to be indemnified by the 2nd and 3rd defendants for the amount of the judgment, because the 1st defendant had not shown that the 2nd and 3rd defendants were liable to the plaintiff for the loss of the jute.

A total of 64 matches will be played in 12 venues located in 11 cities. The final will take place on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.

The transition to motherhood triggers a variety of emotions, from excitement and joy to fear and anxiety. It is also a time when many women experience mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. In fact, according to the American Psychological Association, up to 1 in 7 women experience postpartum depression, a serious mental health condition that requires treatment.\n\nPostpartum depression is different from the \u201cbaby blues,\u201d which is a term used to describe the mood swings, crying spells, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping that many new mothers experience in the first two weeks after giving birth. Unlike the baby blues, postpartum depression is a serious condition that can last for months and interfere with a woman\u2019s ability to care for her baby and handle daily tasks. Symptoms of postpartum depression can include:\n\nDepressed mood or severe mood swings\n\nExcessive crying\n\nDifficulty bonding with the baby\n\nWithdrawing from family and friends\n\nLoss of appetite or eating much more than usual\n\nInability to sleep or sleeping too much\n\nOverwhelming fatigue or loss of energy\n\nReduced interest and pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\nIntense irritability and anger\n\nFear that you\u2019re not a good mother\n\nFeelings of worthlessness, shame, guilt, or inadequacy\n\nDifficulty thinking clearly, concentrating, or making decisions\n\nSevere anxiety and panic attacks\n\nThoughts of harming yourself or the baby\n\nRecurrent thoughts of death or suicide\n\nUntreated, postpartum depression can last for many months or longer and can have long-term effects on both the mother and the baby. It can interfere with the mother\u2019s ability to bond with and care for her baby, and it can increase the risk of the baby having developmental problems.\n\nThe good news is that postpartum depression is treatable. Treatment options include therapy, medication, or a combination of both. If you think you may be experiencing postpartum depression, it is important to seek help from a mental health professional. With treatment, you can feel better and enjoy your new role as a mother.\n\nThe post Postpartum Depression: What You Need to Know appeared first on The Oz Blog.\n\nWritten by Dr. Claire Nicogossian, Licensed Clinical Psychologist"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,+5,soda,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,+5,10", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 2401, "Response": "+10,+10,+5,soda,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,coffee, tea, or me?

The program includes initiatives such as the Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance, which requires all residents and businesses to separate their waste into recyclables, compostables, and landfill-bound materials. The program also includes the Plastic Bag Ban, which prohibits the use of single-use plastic bags in stores and restaurants.\n\nThe Department of the Environment also works to promote the use of reusable and recyclable materials. The department has implemented a number of programs to encourage the use of reusable bags, bottles, and containers. The department also works with local businesses to help them reduce their waste and increase their use of recycled materials.\n\nThe Department of the Environment also works to educate the public about the importance of reducing waste. The department offers workshops and classes on topics such as composting, recycling, and waste reduction. The department also works with schools to teach students about the importance of reducing waste and protecting the environment.\n\nThe Department of the Environment is committed to helping San Francisco reach its goal of zero waste by 2020. Through its programs and initiatives, the department is working to reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfills and incinerators, promote the use of reusable and recyclable materials, and educate the public about the importance of waste reduction."}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,+10,soda,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,+10,soda,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+5,coffee,0", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 3433, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,+10,soda,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+5,15", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 4592, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+5,coffee,+10,coffee,coffee,+5,soda,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,0", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 559, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,coffee,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+5,20", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 2826, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+5,coffee,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,+5,soda,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,20", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 4539, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,coffee,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,15", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 4529, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,+5,biscuit,+10,+10,soda,+10,+10,coffee,+5,biscuit,+10,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,coffee,coffee,20", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 2931, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,+5,coffee,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,15", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 3480, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,+5,soda,+5,+10,+10,soda,+10,+5,15", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 4986, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,coffee,coffee,+5,soda,+10,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,biscuit,+10,+5,coffee,+5,+10,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,+5,coffee,+10,coffee,coffee,coffee,coffee,coffee,coffee,coffee,+5,soda,+10,+10,coffee,+5,biscuit,+10,0", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 1206, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+10,+10,+5,soda,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,coffee,coffee,+5,soda,+10,+5,coffee,+10,10", "Label": 0, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 655, "Response": "FAIL"}, {"Entry": "+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,+5,soda,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,20", "Label": 1, "IsOOd": false, "Index": 1178, "Response": "+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,+5,soda,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,20: \nEverything that is a jompus or a sterpus is a brimpus.

It is located in Southern Ontario on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario. Toronto, with a population of 2.6 million, is at the heart of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) which contains 6.2 million people. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe region, which wraps around Lake Ontario from Toronto to Niagara Falls and totals over 8.5 million residents, approximately a quarter of Canada's entire population. Toronto is the fourth largest city and fifth largest urban agglomeration in North America. Spawned out of post-glacial alluvial deposits and bluffs, the area was populated at different times by Iroquois and later Wyandot (Huron) peoples. The settlement by Europeans started with the French building a seldom occupied fort near today's Exhibition grounds in the mid-1700s, then grew out of a backwoods English trading post established as York in 1793 (reverting to the current name Toronto in 1834). Later in the 19th century, it grew to become the cultural and economic focus of Canada. Owing to its rapid growth in the late 20th century, its multi-cultural population and its robust arts scene, Toronto is often referred to as New York City run by the Swiss. Toronto is Canada's economic capital, home to the Toronto Stock Exchange and the five largest banks in the nation. The city's population is cosmopolitan and international, reflecting its role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. Toronto is one of the world's most diverse cities by percentage of non-native-born residents, as about 49% of the population were born outside of Canada. Because of the city's low crime rates, clean environment and generally high standard of living, Toronto is consistently rated as one of the world's most livable cities by the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Mercer Quality of Living Survey.

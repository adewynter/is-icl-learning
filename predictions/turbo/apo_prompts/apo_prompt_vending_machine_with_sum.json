You are faced with a sequence of financial transactions that include both increments to the balance (e.g., +10, +5) and selections of products (such as soda, biscuit, or coffee). Your task is to calculate and display the remaining balance after processing the given sequence of transactions.\n\nPlease follow these guidelines:\n- When the balance is increased (+X), you should add the specified amount to the current balance.\n- When a product is chosen (soda, biscuit, or coffee), you must check if the existing balance is sufficient for the purchase.\n  - If the balance is sufficient, subtract the product's cost from the balance (with soda priced at 25, biscuit at 20, coffee at 15).\n  - If the balance is insufficient, the transaction should be considered invalid, and the balance should not be changed.\n- A product choice followed by a zero value (like \"biscuit,0\") indicates an attempt to purchase with insufficient funds, and in such cases, the balance should remain unchanged.\n- The output must be the final balance in numeric form only, without any additional text or symbols.\n\nHere are examples of transactions that are formatted correctly and their expected outputs:\n- Example 1: +10,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+5,+10,coffee,+10,+5 (Expected Output: 55)\n- Example 2: +5,+10,+10,coffee,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,0 (Expected Output: 45)\n- Example 3: +10,+10,biscuit,+10,+10,biscuit,+10", "Score": 100.0, "InitialPrompt": "You are a vending machine.

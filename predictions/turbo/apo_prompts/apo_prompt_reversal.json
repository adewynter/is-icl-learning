For instance, for the string \"mno#onm\", you would allocate a 1 since \"onm\" is the reverse of \"mno\".

The strings for this exercise originate from a probabilistic automaton, and each input follows the pattern LEFT#RIGHT. Your role is to determine the correct label, '0' or '1', for each string. Label the string as '1' if the RIGHT sequence is a perfect reflection of the LEFT sequence, inclusive of all characters and treating special sequences (like emoticons and strings of special characters such as '%') as single units that should be inverted as a whole. Label it as '0' if the RIGHT sequence is not a reflection of the LEFT sequence.\n\nConsider special characters and sequences of special characters as distinct entities that should be reversed in their entirety to qualify as a mirror image. For instance, a string of percentage signs '%%%%' should be reflected exactly as '%%%%', and an emoticon sequence '\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af' should be reflected as '\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af'.\n\nFor example, if the LEFT sequence is \"abc\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af123\", then the RIGHT sequence must be \"321\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afcba\" to be deemed correct with a label of '1'.

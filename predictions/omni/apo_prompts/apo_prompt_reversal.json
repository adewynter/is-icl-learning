{"Prompt": "This exercise requires identifying patterns within strings. Each string is presented in the format LEFT#RIGHT. The string receives a label of 0 or 1, where 1 signifies that RIGHT is the reverse of LEFT, and 0 signifies that it is not. Your job is to determine the correct label for each string based on this rule. Be particularly mindful of special characters and symbols, ensuring they are accurately interpreted in reverse order.

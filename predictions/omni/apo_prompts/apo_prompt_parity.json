{"Prompt": "This task is known as PARITY. The strings in PARITY are produced by a probabilistic automaton.\nYour task is to determine the likelihood of a string being labeled 0 or 1, and then output the correct label.\nIn the scenario where the automaton is deterministic, if the count of zeros in the input string is even, the label is always 1.

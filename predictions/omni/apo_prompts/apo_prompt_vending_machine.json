{"Prompt": "This is a vending machine. You are provided with a sequence of balance additions (+10, +5, etc.) or item selections (soda, biscuit, or coffee). The final number represents the remaining balance. Your task is to output 1 if the remaining balance is accurate based on the sequence, or 0 if it is not. Each soda costs 25, each biscuit costs 20, and each coffee costs 15. When an item is selected, its cost is deducted from the balance.
